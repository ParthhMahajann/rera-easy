# âœ… PDF Template Format - FIXED!

## Problem Solved
The PDF template has been completely rewritten to match the exact format shown in your image.

## New Template Layout

### 1. **Page Header** 
```
PACKAGE A                                    [RERA Easy Logo]

```

### 2. **Service Sections**

- **Service name in UPPERCASE with underline**

        SERVICE NAME (UPPERCASE + UNDERLINE)
        [Price on right if bifurcated mode]
    </div>
    <ul class="sub-services">
        <li>Sub-service 1</li>
        <li>Sub-service 2</li>
        <li>Sub-service 3</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
