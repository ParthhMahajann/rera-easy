# 🔧 PDF Template Fix - READY!

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

### **Problem:**
The PDF was showing only the "Total Payable Amount" section and terms, missing all the service sections with bullet points.

### **Root Cause:**
The PDF generator was using the **wrong template** (`quotation_template.html` instead of `quotation_summary_template.html`) due to a bug in the template selection logic.

### **Solution Applied:**
Fixed line 14 in `backend/pdf_generator.py`:
```python
# BEFORE (Bug):
self.template_name = "quotation_template.html" if use_summary_template else "quotation_template.html"

# AFTER (Fixed):
self.template_name = "quotation_summary_template.html" if use_summary_template else "quotation_template.html"
```

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### **Step 1: Restart Backend Server**
The fix is already applied in the code, but you need to **restart your backend server** to pick up the changes.

```bash
# Stop your current backend server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
cd D:\rera-easy\backend
python app.py
```

### **Step 2: Test PDF Generation**
1. Go to a quotation summary page
2. Select either "Lump Sum" or "Bifurcated" mode
3. Click "Download Quotation"
4. The PDF should now show:
   - ✅ **PACKAGE A** header with logo
   - ✅ **SERVICE SECTIONS** with underlined headers
   - ✅ **Bullet points** for all sub-services
   - ✅ **Package total** 
   - ✅ **Grand total**
   - ✅ **Terms & conditions**
