## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Items (Non-Critical)

### 1. Frontend Testing Suite
**Status:** Partial  
**Impact:** Low - Core functionality verified

**Current State:**
- Simple test runner created and functional
- Component structure verified
- API configuration confirmed
- Dependencies validated

**Recommendation:** 
- Install Jest/React Testing Library for comprehensive component testing
- Set up proper testing environment: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`

### 2. End-to-End Testing
**Status:** Framework ready, needs setup  
**Impact:** Low - Manual testing confirms functionality

**Current State:**
- Playwright test suite created
- Test scenarios defined
- Needs Playwright installation

**Recommendation:**
- Install Playwright: `npm install @playwright/test`
- Run initial E2E tests: `npx playwright test`

### 3. Security Headers Enhancement
**Status:** Optional for production  
**Impact:** Very Low - Core security functional

**Missing Headers (Non-Critical):**
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options  
- X-XSS-Protection

**Recommendation:**
- Add security headers in Flask configuration for production deployment
