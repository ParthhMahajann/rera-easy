# ✅ PDF Template Issues - ALL FIXED!

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Issue 1: Missing Sub-services**
**Problem:** Some services were showing bullet points, others weren't.
**Solution:** Enhanced sub-services rendering logic with proper iteration handling:
```html
<!-- Robust sub-services rendering -->
{% if service.subServices %}
    {% set sub_services_list = service.subServices if service.subServices is iterable else [] %}
    {% if sub_services_list|length > 0 %}
        <ul class="sub-services">
            {% for sub_service in sub_services_list %}
                {% if sub_service %}
                    {% if sub_service is mapping %}
                        <li>{{ sub_service.name if sub_service.name else sub_service|string }}</li>
                    {% else %}
                        <li>{{ sub_service|string }}</li>
                    {% endif %}
                {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

### **Issue 2: Logo Positioning**
**Problem:** Logo was on top-right, should be top-left.
**Solution:** Moved logo to left side of header:
```html
<div class="page-header">
    <div class="header-left">
        <!-- Logo on LEFT -->
        <img src="{{ logo_src }}" alt="RERA Easy Logo" class="logo">
        <h1 class="page-title">{{ page_title }}</h1>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **Issue 3: Service Name and Price Alignment**
**Problem:** Service names and prices were not aligned on the same line.
**Solution:** Used flexbox for proper alignment:
```css
.service-header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: baseline;
}

.service-name {
    flex: 1;
}

.service-amount {
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-left: 10px;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
```

### **Issue 4: Page Breaking**
**Problem:** Service sections were splitting across pages.
**Solution:** Added page break prevention:
```css
.service-section {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
    break-inside: avoid;
}

.package-total {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
}

.terms {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
}
```
