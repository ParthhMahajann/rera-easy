# 🚨 BACKEND SERVER RESTART REQUIRED

## Issue Found ✅

The pricing function is working correctly when tested directly:
- ✅ Direct test: `PROJECT REGISTRATION SERVICES` returns ₹140,000 (correct)
- ❌ Your frontend shows: ₹50,000 (fallback price)

**Root Cause**: Your Flask backend server is not running or not using the updated code.

## Solution: Restart Backend Server

### Step 1: Stop Current Server (if running)
If you have a terminal window running the backend server, press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

### Step 2: Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Server is Running
You should see output like:
```
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:3001
 * Debug mode: on
```

### Step 4: Test the Frontend
After the server starts, refresh your frontend page. You should now see:
- ✅ PROJECT REGISTRATION SERVICES: ₹140,000
- ✅ Form 1: ₹20,000  
- ✅ Form 3: ₹20,000
- ✅ CHANGE OF PROMOTER: ₹750,000
- ✅ And other correct prices from your JSON

## Why This Happened
The backend server caches code when it starts. Our changes to `services_data.py` are not active until the server restarts.

## Verification
Once restarted, the server will use:
1. ✅ Updated pricing data from your JSON
2. ✅ Service name mapping (frontend names → JSON names)  
3. ✅ Exact pricing without multipliers
4. ✅ Fresh data loading on each request
